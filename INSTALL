INSTALL instructions for <NAME>

1. Install some flavor of mpi and PETSc.  See http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/petsc-as/developers/index.html

The development version of PETSc is required.  Shared libraries are recommended for use with petsc4py, the preferred mode of loading output for plotting in matplotlib/python.  Note that PETSc can install MPICH2 for you automatically using the --download-mpich option.   

Recommended (quick start) configure line:

./configure --with-shared-libararies=1 --download-mpich=1 --with-debugging=1


2. Set the environmental variable LBM_DIR to directory containing the <NAME> installation (likely the directory containing this file!) 

3. Build the base executable by running ``make'' in the src/lbm directory.

4. Run a test by by running ``make test'' in one of the test directories in tests
